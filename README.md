# Arkapong

Arkapong is the mix of two classic games “Arkanoid” and “Pong”. Arkapong needs two players to complete with each other in one computer. The control of Arkapong is simple: Player1 needs to use W/S to control your paddle, and the Player2 needs to use ↑/↓ to control the paddle.

There are two modes in Arkapong, the Pong mode has the same rule as Pong, except your paddle can be destroyed by the ball.  In the Kill Your Self mode,  players have to catch the ball and destroy their own bricks. The player who first destroy all his bricks win the game.
